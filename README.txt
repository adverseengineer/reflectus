Resizing the game windows
This game is played using two windows. For the best experience, you should resize each window to fill half your screen.
This is done in a few ways, depending on your operating system.
Windows
	Press the Windows key and the left or right arrow keys simultaneously
OS X
	If you are using a Mac, you can click and hold the mouse over the green button in the upper-left corner of a window and choose the appropriate option from the drop-down menu.
	Note that this only works on OS X El Capitan or later. In older versions, you must manually click and drag the window borders
Linux
	This may vary depending on what desktop you are using, but for most of them it is done the same as Windows
	If your keyboard doesn't have a Windows key, use whatever key your system designates as the "super key"
